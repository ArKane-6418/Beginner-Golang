Workspaces allow us to work with multiple modules simultaneously without having to edit go.mod files for each module. Each module within a workspace is treated as a root module when resolving dependencies.
"go work init" creates the workspace (the go.work file)
"go work use ./hello" will add the created hello module to the workspace
